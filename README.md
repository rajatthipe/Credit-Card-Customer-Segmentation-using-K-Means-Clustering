# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

This repository contains a project that uses K-Means clustering to segment credit card customers based on their spending behavior.

## Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses to understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies. 
This project leverages the power of K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group customers with similar spending patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a sample credit card dataset (details can be found in the notebook). 
It typically includes features like:

* Customer ID
* Spending Amount
* Purchase Frequency
* Credit Limit
* ... (other relevant features)

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  The data is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering :** New features might created to enhance the clustering process.
3. **K-Means Clustering:** The K-Means algorithm is applied to the data to group customers into distinct segments.
    The optimal number of clusters is determined using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.
4. **Cluster Analysis:**  The characteristics of each cluster are analyzed to understand the spending behavior of customers within that segment.
5. **Visualization:**  Clusters are visualized to provide a clear picture of the customer segments.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
